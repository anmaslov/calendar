# Go Development Guidelines

## Code Style
- Follow standard Go conventions (gofmt, golint)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use wrapped errors with context: `fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", err)`
- Don't ignore errors with `_`

## Project Structure
- Use `/cmd` for main applications
- Use `/internal` for private code
- Use `/internal/api` for API definitions (proto, OpenAPI)

## Testing
- Write table-driven tests
- Use testify for assertions when needed
- Name test files with `_test.go` suffix
- Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests

## Dependencies
- Use Go modules
- Keep go.mod clean and updated
- Prefer standard library when possible
